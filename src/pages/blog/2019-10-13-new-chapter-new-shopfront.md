As we shift gear following our recent series A fundraise, we thought it was high time we reboot our website to reflect the exciting new chapter in our story. It's not always easy to design a compelling experience that speaks to four very different audiences. We knew the site needed to:

1. communicate the “horizontal” nature of the Lavanda platform - our ability to solve real problems and power new opportunities across four industries (multifamily BTR, serviced apartments, short-term rentals and PBSA);
2. help our different audiences navigate to relevant and useful information as easily as possible; and
3. streamline the process of booking a product demo with one of our industry experts.

This first iteration is a just a taste what we are planning to unveil over the coming weeks and months. Please check out https://getlavanda.com and let us know how we’re getting along and what we can be doing better. All feedback welcome.
