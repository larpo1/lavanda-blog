          Lavanda may disclose your information, including personal information,
          to courts, law enforcement or governmental authorities, or authorized
          third parties, if and to the extent we are required or permitted to do

          with our legal obligations, (ii) to comply with legal process and to
          respond to claims asserted against Lavanda, (iii) to respond to
          verified requests relating to a criminal investigation or alleged or

          court order we receive, or by applicable law, or (ii) we believe that
          providing notice would be futile, ineffective, create a risk of injury
          or bodily harm to an individual or group, or create or increase a risk
          of fraud upon Lavanda’s property, its Members and the Lavanda
          Platforms. In instances where we comply with legal requests without
          notice for these reasons, we will attempt to notify that Member about
          the request after the fact where appropriate and where we determine in
          good faith that we are no longer prevented from doing so.

          yourself within your Lavanda Account).
        </p>
        <h4>4.3 Data Access and Portability</h4>
        <p>
          In some jurisdictions, applicable law may entitle you to request
          copies of your personal information held by us. You may also be
          entitled to request copies of personal information that you have
          provided to us in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable
          format and/or request us to transmit this information to another
          service provider (where technically feasible).
        </p>
        <h4>4.4 Data Retention and Erasure</h4>
        <p>
          We generally retain your personal information for as long as is
          necessary for the performance of the contract between you and us and
          to comply with our legal obligations. If you no longer want us to use
          your information to provide a Lavanda Platform to you, you can request
          that we erase your personal information and close your Lavanda
          Account. Please note that if you request the erasure of your personal
          information:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            We may retain some of your personal information as necessary for our
            legitimate business interests, such as fraud detection and
            prevention and enhancing safety. For example, if we suspend a
            Lavanda Account for fraud or safety reasons, we may retain certain
            information from that Lavanda Account to prevent that Member from
            opening a new Lavanda Account in the future.
          </li>
          <li>
            We may retain and use your personal information to the extent
            necessary to comply with our legal obligations. For example, we may
            keep some of your information for tax, legal reporting and auditing
            obligations.
          </li>
          <li>
            Because we maintain the Lavanda Platforms to protect from accidental
            or malicious loss and destruction, residual copies of your personal
            information may not be removed from our backup systems for a limited
            period of time.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>4.5 Withdrawing Consent and Restriction of Processing</h4>
        <p>
          Where you have provided your consent to the processing of your
          personal information by Lavanda you may withdraw your consent at any
          time by contacting your Account or Partner Manager. Please note that
          the withdrawal of your consent does not affect the lawfulness of any
          processing activities based on such consent before its withdrawal.
          Additionally, in some jurisdictions, applicable law may give you the
          right to limit the ways in which we use your personal information, in
          particular where (i) you contest the accuracy of your personal
          information; (ii) the processing is unlawful and you oppose the
          erasure of your personal information; (iii) we no longer need your
          personal information for the purposes of the processing, but you
          require the information for the establishment, exercise or defence of
          legal claims; or (iv) you have objected to the processing pursuant to
          Section 6.6 and pending the verification whether the legitimate
          grounds of Lavanda override your own.
        </p>
        <h4>4.6 Objection to Processing</h4>
        <p>
          In some jurisdictions, applicable law may entitle you to require
          Lavanda not to process your personal information for certain specific
          purposes (including profiling) where such processing is based on
          legitimate interest. If you object to such processing, Lavanda will no
          longer process your personal information for these purposes unless we
          can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for such processing or
          such processing is required for the establishment, exercise or defence
          of legal claims.
        </p>
        <p>
          Where your personal information is processed for direct marketing
          purposes, you may, at any time ask Lavanda to cease processing your
          data for these direct marketing purposes by contacting us via our website.
        </p>
        <h4>4.7 Lodging Complaints</h4>
        <p>
          You have the right to lodge complaints about the data processing
          activities carried out by Lavanda before the competent data protection
          authorities (the Information Commissioner’s Office).
        </p>
        <h3>5. DATA TRANSFERS</h3>
        <p>
          In the event that Lavanda is merged with or acquired by another
          company your personal information may be disclosed to our advisers, or
          any prospective acquirer and their advisers. In the event of a
          successful transaction, your personal information will be passed on to
          the new owners of the business.
        </p>
        <h3>6. LINKS TO THIRD PARTY SITES</h3>
        <p>
          Our website and software platforms may, from time to time, contain
          links to and from the websites of our partner networks, advertisers,
          affiliates or third-party partners. If you follow a link to any of

        <p>
          We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13. If we
